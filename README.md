CreditCardView
==================

CreditCardView is an Android library that allows developers to create the UI which replicates an actual Credit Card. 
Storing the credit card details inside the app has become a very common use case seen in a lot of different apps, but it is often represented in a not so intuitive manner. I created this library with the aim of making the process of storing the credit cards more visually appealing to the users of your app.
